This Maven plugin takes XMIR generated by [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
and tries to transform combinations of `opcode` objects into EO objects.

Input:

```
seq > @
  opcode > NEW-187-29
    "org/eolang/ineo/A"
  opcode > DUP-89-30
  opcode > BIPUSH-16-31
    42
  opcode > INVOKESPECIAL-183-32
    "org/eolang/ineo/A"
    "<init>"
    "(I)V"
```

Output:

```
(org-eolang-ineo-A 42).init
```

Then, it can translate declarative EO code back to imperative EO code which 
uses `opcode` atoms.
