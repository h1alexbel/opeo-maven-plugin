This Maven plugin takes XMIR generated by [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
and tries to transform combinations of `opcode` objects into EO objects.

Input:

```
seq > @
  opcode > NEW-187-29
    "org/eolang/ineo/A"
  opcode > DUP-89-30
  opcode > BIPUSH-16-31
    42
  opcode > INVOKESPECIAL-183-32
    "org/eolang/ineo/A"
    "<init>"
    "(I)V"
```

Output:

```
+alias org.eolang.ineo.jA

jA 42 > x
x.init
```

Then, it can translate declarative EO code back to imperative EO code which
uses `opcode` atoms.

## How to Use

The opeo-maven-plugin comprises two goals: `decompile` and `compile`. The decompile goal processes the output of
the `jeo-maven-plugin`, converting it into high-level EO code. On the other hand, the compile goal processes the
high-level EO code, transforming it back into low-level EO code that is compatible with the `jeo-maven-plugin`.
Below, you will find examples demonstrating how to execute the plugin.

### Direct Command

To execute the `opeo-maven-plugin`, you need a minimum of **Maven 3.1.+** and **Java 11+** installed on your system.
You can initiate the plugin from the command line with a single command. For instance, to transform the output generated
by the `jeo-maven-plugin` into high-level EO code, you can utilize the following command:

```shell
mvn opeo:decompile
```

Subsequently, you can convert the high-level EO code back to low-level EO code, which is also compatible with the
`jeo-maven-plugin`. To accomplish this, use the following command:

```shell
mvn opeo:compile
```

### Maven Build

Another way to use the plugin is to add it directly to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
  <artifactId>opeo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.4</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>opeo-decompile</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>decompile</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
    <execution>
      <id>opeo-compile</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>compile</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

The default phase for the both goals is `process-classes`.
