 * @todo: Conflict between {@link StoreToArrayAgent} and {@link DupAgent}.
 *  We have a strange conflict between these two agents.
 *  - {@link StoreToArrayAgent} is supposed to leave stack empty, or at least do not push anything,
 *  but it pushes a new {@link StoreArray} object. Which is wrong.
 *  - {@link DupAgent} is supposed to push a new object, but it does not push anything.
 *  However both this bugs compensate each other somehow and our transformations work
 *  as expected. But this is not a good practice. We should adhere to bytecode specification for
 *  both agents: {@link DupAgent} should push a new object and {@link StoreToArrayAgent} should
 *  not push anything.
